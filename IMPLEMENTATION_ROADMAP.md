## Production Deployment Plan

### Preparation

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - [ ] Allocate compute resources for collector instances
   - [ ] Set up persistent storage for BoltDB checkpoints
   - [ ] Configure networking between collectors and New Relic

2. **Configuration Tuning**:
   - [ ] Determine optimal reservoir size based on traffic patterns
   - [ ] Calculate appropriate window duration for workload
   - [ ] Configure trace buffer timeouts based on trace completion time
   - [ ] Set up database compaction schedule

3. **Monitoring Setup**:
   - [ ] Configure alerts for key metrics
   - [ ] Set up resource usage monitoring
   - [ ] Establish baseline performance metrics

### Limited Deployment

1. **Shadow Mode Deployment**:
   - [ ] Deploy in non-sampling mode with debug output
   - [ ] Validate spans flow through processor correctly
   - [ ] Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)

2. **Limited Sampling**:
   - [ ] Enable sampling at 1:1 ratio (keep all traces)
   - [ ] Verify trace preservation in trace-aware mode
   - [ ] Ensure end-to-end delivery to New Relic

3. **Load Testing**:
   - [ ] Gradually increase traffic to target levels
   - [ ] Validate performance under load
   - [ ] Test recovery after crashes or restarts

### Full Deployment

1. **Production Rollout**:
   - [ ] Configure for target sampling rates
   - [ ] Deploy to production environment
   - [ ] Monitor initial operation closely

2. **Validation**:
   - [ ] Verify traces appear correctly in New Relic
   - [ ] Ensure trace completeness metrics meet targets
   - [ ] Validate checkpoint persistence across restarts

3. **Optimization**:
   - [ ] Tune pipeline based on observed performance
   - [ ] Adjust buffer sizes and timeouts if needed
   - [ ] Scale horizontally if throughput requirements increase

## Future Enhancements

1. **Technical Improvements**:
   - [ ] Replace deprecated github.com/boltdb/bolt with go.etcd.io/bbolt
   - [ ] Add compression option for serialized spans
   - [ ] Implement adaptive timeout for trace completion
   - [ ] Add distributed sampling coordination

2. **Feature Additions**:
   - [ ] Support for sampling based on trace attributes
   - [ ] Add different reservoir algorithms (time-decay, priority)
   - [ ] Implement configuration hot-reloading
   - [ ] Add REST API for runtime monitoring and control

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Memory Usage**:
   - **Risk**: Large trace buffers could lead to excessive memory consumption
   - **Mitigation**: Implement aggressive LRU eviction and memory monitoring

2. **Disk I/O**:
   - **Risk**: Checkpoint operations could impact performance
   - **Mitigation**: Use batched writes and asynchronous checkpointing

3. **Data Loss**:
   - **Risk**: Crashes between checkpoints could lose sampled spans
   - **Mitigation**: Use frequent incremental checkpoints and WAL

4. **Scaling**:
   - **Risk**: Single-instance limitations for very high volume
   - **Mitigation**: Document horizontal scaling approaches, shard by trace ID
