# Trace-Aware Reservoir Sampler + NR-DOT Implementation Status

This document summarizes the implementation status of integrating the trace-aware-reservoir-otel processor with the New Relic OpenTelemetry Distribution (NR-DOT).

## Completed Steps

1. ✅ Created a tag for the Reservoir Sampler repository (`v0.1.0`)
2. ✅ Cloned the NR-DOT repository and created a feature branch
3. ✅ Updated manifest files to include our processor (though commented out for local testing)
4. ✅ Created deployment configurations:
   - `values.reservoir.yaml` for Helm deployment
   - `kind-config.yaml` for local testing
   - `Dockerfile` for custom image building
   - `deploy.sh` script for automated deployment
5. ✅ Set up Kubernetes context for deployment (Docker Desktop)

## Current Challenges

1. The processor import path in the manifest points to a GitHub repository that doesn't exist publicly (`github.com/deepakshrma/trace-aware-reservoir-otel`).
2. Build tools like Make are not available in the current environment.
3. The build process is complex and requires modification for non-standard setups.

## Next Steps

1. **Repository Publication**: Before the integration can be completed, the trace-aware-reservoir-otel repository needs to be published to GitHub at the specified path, or the import path needs to be updated to match the actual repository location.

2. **Build Environment Setup**: Set up a proper build environment with all required tools:
   - Install Make
   - Configure local Go module replacement if needed

3. **Complete the Build**: Once the environment is set up and the repository is published:
   - Run `make dist` to build the distribution
   - Verify the processor is included with `_dist/nrdot/otelcol-nrdot components | grep reservoir_sampler`

4. **Docker Image Build and Push**:
   ```bash
   export IMAGE=ghcr.io/<username>/nrdot-reservoir:v0.1.0
   docker build -t $IMAGE _dist/nrdot/
   docker push $IMAGE
   ```

5. **Kubernetes Deployment with Helm**:
   ```bash
   helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
   helm repo update
   helm install otel-reservoir newrelic/nri-bundle \
     -f values.reservoir.yaml \
     --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY \
     --set global.cluster=reservoir-demo
   ```

## Testing Strategy

Once deployed, verify the integration by:

1. **Component Registration**: Check metrics for `processor_reservoir_sampler`
2. **Reservoir Metrics**: Monitor `reservoir_sampler.reservoir_size`
3. **Badger Database**: Check `reservoir_sampler.db_size` and compaction metrics
4. **Window Rollover**: Look for window rollover logs

## Conclusion

The groundwork for integrating the trace-aware-reservoir-otel processor with NR-DOT has been laid. The necessary configuration files have been created, and the approach has been documented. To complete the implementation, the repository needs to be published and a proper build environment set up.

This implementation follows the approach described in `NRDOT-INTEGRATION.md` but has been adapted based on the current environment constraints. The core integration steps remain the same, but the exact implementation details may vary depending on the specific environment and deployment requirements.
